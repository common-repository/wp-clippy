Adds a flash button that copies the value of an element or string to the clipboard when clicked.

== Description ==
Shortcode to add a button that loads either the value of a given HTML form element or a supplied string to the clipboard when clicked on. The button is Flash (as required for security reasons in Flash 10+), but it mimics the look and behavior of the default WordPress buttons fairly closely. 

Use the shortcode format `[clippy id="id_of_form_element"]` or `[clippy value="string to load directly to clipboard"]`.

1. Download the latest zip file and extract the `wp-clippy` directory.
2. Upload this directory inside your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

4. Insert the [clippy] shortcode in a post or page.
